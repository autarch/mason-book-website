The animal on the cover of Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason is a Hamadryas
(Arabian) baboon. This species inhabits the dry plains and rocky hills of
northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Though their primary diet consists
of roots, seeds, and fruit, Hamadryas baboons also eat insects and small
animals, including other monkeys. They travel and forage in bands of 50 to 100
during the day and gather in troops as large as 750 to sleep on steep-sided
cliffs during the night. All adults have long, dense, silky fur that is gray in
males and brownish in females. Mature males weigh an average of 45 pounds and
have a silver cape or mane over the head, neck, and shoulders. Females are
considerably smaller and have no mane.

Arabian baboons live in a highly developed social order based on harem groups-a
single adult male is accompanied by up to four females and their offspring.
Males control their family by brute force, often biting females on the nape of
the neck. Their powerful canines are also bared to threaten predators, which
include leopards, jackals, hyenas, cheetahs, and lions. When facing an attack,
they may yawn, slap their hands and feet, scream, and alert other baboons with
a dog-like bark. They are fierce combatants, often winning fights against
animals larger than themselves.

Ancient Egyptian artwork frequently pictures Hamadryas baboons as attendants of
Thoth, scribe of the gods, and himself the god of wisdom, learning, and magic.
The Egyptians recognized the intelligence of &quot;sacred&quot; baboons and
reportedly trained them to wait on tables, pluck weeds from garden plots, and
assume positions of prayer when in a temple. They also helped make wine; tomb
paintings depict them harvesting grapes and using their own body weight to
increase the tension of wine presses. Today these baboons are listed as a
threatened species, and they no longer inhabit Egypt. Cultivation and
development have destroyed much of their natural habitat and forced some bands
to rely on crops and garbage dumps for food.
