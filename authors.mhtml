 <h4>Dave Rolsky</h4>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 <strong>Dave Rolsky</strong> has worked as a paperboy, supermarket
 bagger, temporary secretary, ear-training and music theory teaching
 assistant, and every so often a computer programmer, specializing in
 Perl.</p>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 He is an animal rights activist, an obsessive reader of the works of
 Gene Wolfe, a Hong Kong film afficionado, and the owner of many black
 t-shirts.

 <p class="authorcontent">
 He has been a member of the Mason core team since the summer of 2000,
 a position he attained primarily by constantly nagging Jon Swartz,
 Mason's creator.
 </p>

 <h4>Ken Williams</h4>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 <strong>Ken Williams</strong> enjoys sitting by the park and taking
 long walks in the fireplace.  He has a hard time staying interested
 in any one thing for very long, so he has recently worked as a math
 teacher, choral conductor, Perl consultant, and liturgical bongoist.
 </p>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 He has written CPAN modules of varying utility while masquerading
 under the seedy, secretive pseudonym <a
 href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/Ken_Williams/">"Ken
 Williams"</a>.
 </p>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 Ken joined the Mason core team in the fall of 2000 and has managed
 to convince the other core members that his flashy looks and his
 appeal with Mason's ultra-hep Gen-Z users outweigh his tendency
 to forget what planet he's on.
 </p>

 <p class="authorcontent">
 He recently moved to Australia to study Document Categorization,
 and that's not a joke.
