<h3>Buy It</h3>

<br>

<h4>Why should you buy it when it's free to read online?</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<h5>Support the authors</h5>
<p class="content">
Writing a book isn't as vastly lucrative as you might suspect, but
every time somebody buys a copy we do get a small financial reward.
Selling more copies means we might be able to write more books in the
future, or put more effort into working on Mason itself.

<li>
<h5>Support making the book freely available</h5>
<p class="content">
O'Reilly has also generously agreed to allow us to make the content of
the book available for reading online, at no cost.  But if this means
nobody's buying the hard copies, you won't likely see such things from
them in the future, as they'll either go out of business or stop
making books freely available.

<li>
<h5>Support Mason in the marketplace</h5>
<p class="content">
Since this is the first book to be published on Mason, its success (or
failure) will no doubt influence O'Reilly (and other publishers, for
that matter) in deciding whether or not more books on Mason are
published.

<li>
<h5>You get an <i>actual book</i></h5>
<p class="content">
Building complicated web sites can be, erm, <i>complicated</i>, and
the last thing you need is another window open on your screen when
you're trying to work.  O'Reilly's books are made of real dead trees,
and they're much easier to cuddle up with beside the fireplace than a
computer is.
