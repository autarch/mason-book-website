<p class="content">
Welcome to the Mason book site.  <em>Embedding Perl in HTML with
Mason</em> was published by <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly and Associates</a> in October
of 2002.
</p>

<p class="content">
<a href="http://www.masonhq.com/">Mason</a> is a powerful text
templating tool for embedding Perl in text.  It offers many
features to help you create dynamic web sites from re-usable
components.  Besides templating, it provides numerous other features
such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to create modular, re-usable components like headers,
      footers, or menus.  You only need to make changes once.
  <li>Integrated parameter handling for web requests.
  <li>Built-in caching as well as a user-accessible cache API.
  <li>Integration with <a href="http://perl.apache.org/"><tt>mod_perl</tt></a>
      for speed and flexibility.
  <li>Content filtering - anything from a small piece of a component
      to an entire site.
</ul>

<p class="content">
The <em>Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason</em> book documents the
<tt>HTML::Mason</tt> framework in detail, including chapters on
component syntax, Mason object APIs, a sample site walkthrough,
recipes, and details on Mason's advanced features and how to use them.
</p>
